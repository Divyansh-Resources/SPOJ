Richard Phillips Feynman was a well known American physicist and a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics. 
He worked in theoretical physics and also pioneered the field of quantum computing. 
He visited South America for ten months, giving lectures and enjoying life in the tropics. He is also known for his books "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!" and 
"What Do You Care What Other People Think?", which include some of his adventures below the equator.

His life-long addiction was solving and making puzzles, locks, and cyphers. Recently, an old farmer in South America, 
who was a host to the young physicist in 1949, found some papers and notes that is believed to have belonged to Feynman. 
Among notes about mesons and electromagnetism, there was a napkin where he wrote a simple puzzle: "how many different squares are there in a grid of N ×N squares?".

In the same napkin there was a drawing which is reproduced below, showing that, for N=2, the answer is 5. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If we are making squares of size i, then the number of squares is given by

(N - (i - 1))^2 ...

If a square of size starts after i at either the row or the column, it will go beyond the size of the frame. 

The range of summation is from i = 1 to N, 

This is the sum of the first N squares which = N*(N + 1)*(2N + 1)/6

int main()
{
    while(true)
    {
        int no_of_squares;
        scanf("%d", &no_of_squares);

        if(no_of_squares == 0) break;

        int answer = (no_of_squares*(no_of_squares + 1)*(2*no_of_squares + 1))/6;
        printf("%d\n", answer);
    }
    return 0;
}
