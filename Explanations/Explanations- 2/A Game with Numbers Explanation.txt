Nikifor and Trofim play the following game: they write some positive integer smaller than 2,000,000,000 and take turns one after another. 
Nikifor is the first to make a move. 
The turn is made by the following rule: from the written integer any non-zero digit is subtracted, and the new integer replaces the old one on the desk. 

For example for integer 40534, the next move can be: 40530, 40531 or 40529. The winner is the player who writes zero on the desk.

Write a program to decide who will win if both players do their best.

---------------------------------------------------------

The trick is to look at the last digit of N.

If the last digit of N is not 0, then the first player subtracts that digit from N.
This makes the last digit of N = 0, for the second player.

Any move the second player does will force N to have a non-zero last digit.
The first player applies the same strategy again.

Notice that the configuration = 0 (mod 10) is only reached by the first player. Hence, the number 0 will also be reached by the first player.

If N's last digit was 0 to begin with. Then any move the first player makes will change the last digit of N and the second player can now apply the 
above strategy.

The first player wins if the last digit is non-zero by subtracting the last digit and loses if the last digit = 0.

int main()
{
    long long n;
    scanf("%lld", &n);

    printf(n%10 == 0 ? "2\n" : "1\n%d\n",n%10);
    return 0;
}
