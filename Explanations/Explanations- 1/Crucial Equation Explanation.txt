Let us see the following equation,

                                            ax+by=c

Given three positive integers a, b and c. You have to determine whether there exists at least one solution for some integers value of x and y 
where x, y may be negative or non-negative integers.

For example if a=2, b=4 and c=8 then the equation will be 2x+4y=8, and hence, for x=2 and y=1, there exists a solution.

Let us see another example for a=3, b=6 and c=7, so the equation will become 3x+6y=7 and there exists no solution satisfying this equation.

---------------------------------------------------

ax + by = c, has solution for  integers a and b if and only if c is divisible by gcd(a, b).

If gcd(a, b) ... a = p.gcd(a, b) and b = q.gcd(a, b)

Equation becomes ... gcd(a, b) [px + qy] = c ... Where p and q are coprime ... Clearly, if c is not divisible by gcd(a, b) ... there are no values of x and y satisfying
equation ...

Now to prove the if part, we need to prove that there always exists integers x and y, such that ax + by = gcd(a, b) ... If c is a multiple of gcd(a, b) .. we just 
multiply the whole equation by k to get the answer

k(ax + by) = k.gcd(a, b) = c

This proofs requires induction and is difficult to write in text form here without latex.

I was shocked to see i got a WA ... and then I saw the comments down and it said that there needs to be a space in between : and Yes ... 
I put it and got AC.
