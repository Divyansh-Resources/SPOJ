You would have been fed up with competitive programming questions so far, now it is time to solve little math.

Assume you have a equation A * x - B * y = 0

For a given value of A and B, find the minimum positive integer value of x and y that satisfies this equation.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, clearly x = B and y = A satisfy the solution, but this is not the minimum possible solution unless A and B are coprime.

We want Ax = By

Cancel out all the common factors of A and B,

A = gcd(A, B) A'
B = gcd(A, B) B'

A'x = B'y

Since there are no common factors, the only way this can be equal is if x = B' and y = A'.

I used the Euclidean GCD algorithm because it was faster to code.
