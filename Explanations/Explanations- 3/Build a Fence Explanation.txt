There is a wall in your backyard. It is so long that you can’t see its endpoints. 
You want to build a fence of length L such that the area enclosed between the wall and the fence is maximized. 
The fence can be of arbitrary shape, but only its two endpoints may touch the wall.

----------------------------------------------

Okay, if there is a figure that has a maximum area with a certain perimeter,

1. It must be convex, or we can reflect about a line crossing the boundary and get a greater area.
2. It must be symmetric or else, we can simply reflect the greater half and geta  greater area with the same circumference.

This is repeating Steiner's argument for the isoperimetric theorem (not completely rigorous).

Basically, the curve which maximises area with a fixed perimeter is a circle.

in this question, we must have two endpoints of this curve on a straight line. Therefore, the best answer is a semi-circle.

C = PI r, is given.

Area = half( PI. r^2 ) = half(PI (C/PI) )^2 = C^2/2PI

Make Circumference a double to avoid floating point precision loss.

--------------------------------------------------------------

void semi_circle_area(double circumference)
{
    const double PI = 3.1415926;

    double area = (circumference*circumference)/(2*PI);
    printf("%.2lf\n", area);
}

int main()
{
    while(true)
    {
        double circumference;
        scanf("%lf", &circumference);

        if(circumference == 0) break;

        semi_circle_area(circumference);
    }

    return 0;
}
